UniversalAndroidToolkit
=======================

Universal Android Toolkit is probably my oldest maintained project, and has had most work put to it. Universal Android Toolkit (or UAT for short) is a set of useful and cross-platform commands and utilities, which allow for Android pros and newbs to easily do cool and impressive things with their Android powered devices! Universal Android Toolkit is written in Java and uses my own JDroidLib, which you can find below. UAT strives to be minimalistic, while maintaining everything you need for developing ROMs, apps and more! At the moment, this is currently in beta, due to a port to Java.
