UniversalAndroidToolkit
=======================

Universal Android Toolkit is my oldest maintained project.
Universal Android Toolkit was first born and released in 2012, where is was released only to testers, at first.
Back then it was written in Visual Basic.NET and only available for Windows.
In 2013, when I started to learn Java, I decided it was time to go full-Linux and decided that Universal Android Toolkit should be a part of 
that.
So, after almost a year of learning Java, I created JDroidLib (http://team-m4gkbeatz.eu/jdroidlib.html) and created Universal Android Toolkit
from scratch. While it takes a lot of time, as adjustments have to be made every now and again, developing Universal Android Toolkit and its 
cousin JDroidLib has been the best and most fun experience I've ever had, and I hope people enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it!

Universal Android Toolkit is fully open source and licensed under the GPL (If you paid money for it, except if you donated to me, you should
consider getting a refund), and is fully open to anyone to take a look at, build there own copy and/or help with development.
To get an idea of why exactly Universal Android Toolkit needs to be open source;
Universal Android Toolkit is designed to work with every version of Android, from 1.5 (Cupcake) up to the (at the time of writing this particular document) 4.4.2 (KitKat). The end goal is to make using your Android device as much a pleasure from your computer, where it's the comfiest, as it is using the device itself.
Universal Android Toolkit offers features, like a file browser, an application and backup manager and several flashing utilities for your connected device/s.
Furthermore, Universal Android Toolkit allows people to perform quite advanced tasks, like unlocking the device's bootloader, updating the device's firmware or even sideloading their custom apps with a few clicks of a button. This gives everyone the equal chance of impressing their friends, until they find out about Universal Android Toolkit, of course.

But that's enough chatter for now.

How 'bout you kick some Android butt and show everyone who's boss. Go ahead and rip the limbs off of Universal Android Toolkit and do some awesome stuff.

Enjoy UAT, and drop a donation if you like it! :) <3
