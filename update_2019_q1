Due to inactivity and me being busy with life, I haven't been able to do much of anything on Github.
Since it's been inactive for 5 years, and in 2018 the original owner continued JDroidLibV2 I'm transfering ownership back
to the original owner, though I have no idea if you'd care for it anymore. 

If declined I'll delete the whole Github.

I'd like to apologize to the original owner for my ignorance and childish act to take ownership.

Do private message me for any questions.
