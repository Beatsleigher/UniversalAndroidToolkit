<p>Universal Android Toolkit is probably my oldest maintained project, and has had most work put to it. Universal Android Toolkit (or UAT for short) is a set of useful and cross-platform commands and utilities, which allow for Android pros and newbs to easily do cool and impressive things with their Android powered devices! Universal Android Toolkit is written in Java and uses my own JDroidLib, which you can find below. UAT strives to be minimalistic, while maintaining everything you need for developing ROMs, apps and more! At the moment, this is currently in beta, due to a port to Java. </p>

<a name="back-to-the-roots" class="anchor" href="#back-to-the-roots"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Back to the... roots?</h3>

<p>Universal Android Toolkit started in mid-2012 as a one-man project, which it still is, today.
It was originally coded in Visual Basic.NET, and stayed that way until 2013. In 2013, there were but two updates or so, and they just changed the design a bit, and didn't add more functionality - For free, at least. Back then, the plan was to keep the features as slick and slow as possible, to get money out of it. But after noticing that people just wouldn't care about it that way, I scrapped that idea and began porting it to Java, seeming as that was my new point of interest, anyway.
It took me just under a year to get a good concept going, and that year was pretty much just re-coding it, scrapping that idea, re-coding it, scrapping, etc. until I got to the current idea.
This idea, I liked, and it was compatible with the way I wanted JDroidLib to be.
So then I began creating all the controls and code which made it what it is now.</p>

<h3>
<a name="why-universal" class="anchor" href="#why-universal"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why 'Universal'?</h3>

<p>Originally, UAT was designed to be a multi-functional set of tools, with features designed for each device individually. Basically, we had a separate window for each device. That window had specific features, kernels, downloads, etc. for each device I chose to support - And believe me, I should not have even tried that!
Nowadays, the 'universal' part of UAT, is that it is cross-platform and that it can be used for any task, as it provides easy access to each and every command found in ADB and fastboot. I didn't want to add a list of commands, because I don't believe that any- and everyone should have access to all of those. Said list may be implemented into the advanced UI, but the simple UI is for the average user, who just wants to quickly install apps from his computer to his device and perform other simple tasks.</p>

<h3>
<a name="ok-cool-so-what-made-this-possible" class="anchor" href="#ok-cool-so-what-made-this-possible"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ok, cool. So... what made this possible?</h3>

<p>UAT was originally made possible by nothing but my own code.
Back then it was literally as basic as could be, just showing the user the output, instead of processing it.
After a year of porting (part of that year was dedicated to re-writing it in VB) I used @regaw_leinad's AndroidLib, which is a very nice API, by the way, and did some cool shiz with that, too.
But that was pretty much it, I think. You'd have to decompile the thing to be sure, I've thankfully forgotten what mess I had created.
Now that UAT has been ported to Java, the application itself only uses JDroidLib, which was written completely by me. (The API, itself). JDroidLib, however, uses Lingala's Zip4J to install ADB and fastboot to any given system, so big thanks to them, for saving me time on creating my own unzipping methods! But apart from that and the occasional buff from friends and acquaintances, like my Team M4gkBeatz, this is all my work. And I'm proud of it.</p>

<h3>
<a name="downloads-section" class="anchor" href="#downloads-section"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Downloads Section</h3>

<p>There are several ways of grabbing a copy of UAT.
The first method being downloading it from SourceForge.
However, please make sure you download the latest (and stable) version!</p>

<pre><code>http://sourceforge.net/p/universalat
</code></pre>

<p>Then there's downloading a copy from the Git itself, there's a folder in the repo, which contains all the official distros, so that users don't get confused, and as SourceForge sometimes takes a few hours to process files, this is just my guarantee, that my updates are available - and quick.</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/Beatsleigher/UniversalAndroidToolkit/tree/master/distros_official
</code></pre>

<p>After that, you can pull a copy of Universal Android Toolkit and JDroidLib, and build your own copy.
Before building your own copy, make sure that you have supplied JDroidLib with the zip4J Lib!
This is always found in the lib folder inside the zip folder that UAT is distributed in!</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/Beatsleigher/UniversalAndroidToolkit.git
</code></pre>

<a name="enjoy" class="anchor" href="#enjoy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Enjoy!</h3>

<p>Enjoy Universal Android Toolkit, and if you like it, don't be afraid to drop me a donation. It helps me get along in life and you'll contribute massively to getting me a new computer!</p>
